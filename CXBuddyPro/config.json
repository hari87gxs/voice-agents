Don't say you can't access it - TRY THE FUNCTION FIRST. If it fails, then explain authentication is needed.",
      "USE SIMPLE QUERIES: When searching, use SHORT, focused queries (3-6 words). If the customer asks 'If I have $1000 in my main account, how much interest?', search for 'Main Account interest rate' - NOT 'interest rate for main GXS savings account balance $1000'. Keep it simple.",

      "TRUST THE TOOL RESULTS: If the tool returns content (not 'No information found'), that IS the answer. Use it to respond to the customer. Don't say 'I couldn't find it' when the tool gave you information.",
      "EACH QUESTION IS INDEPENDENT: If you couldn't answer a previous question, that doesn't mean you can't answer the next one. Treat each new question with a fresh start - search and use the results you get.",

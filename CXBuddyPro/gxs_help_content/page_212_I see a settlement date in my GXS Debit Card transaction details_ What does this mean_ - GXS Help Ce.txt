================================================================================

Settlement date is the date on which the funds you spent with your GXS Debit Card are transferred to the merchant.
As settlement is initiated by the merchant, the settlement date may happen any time from a few days to weeks after your transaction date.
From the time of your transaction until the settlement date, the funds were placed on hold and not available for your use.

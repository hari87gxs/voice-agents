================================================================================

There are several steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:
Check Lighting and Visibility:
Ensure that your face is well-lit and clearly visible. Poor lighting conditions can interfere with the face recognition process.
Remove any accessories that might obscure your face, such as sunglasses, hats, or masks. These can prevent the system from getting a clear view of your face features.
Camera Functionality:
Make sure your device's camera is functioning properly. Clean the camera lens to ensure there are no smudges or dirt affecting the image quality.
Verify that your camera is not damaged and is capable of capturing clear images.

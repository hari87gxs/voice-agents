By default, your GXS FlexiCard spending limit is set to S$500. Here's how you can change it:
On the GXS FlexiCard homescreen, tap on 'Manage'.
Tap on 'Set daily card transaction limit'.
Adjust your limit and click on 'Confirm'.
From here on, card purchases that exceed your spending limit will not be approved.

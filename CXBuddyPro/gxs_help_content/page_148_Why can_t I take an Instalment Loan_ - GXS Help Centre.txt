Sorry to hear that! Below could be some reasons why you can’t borrow a new loan:
10 active loans: You can only borrow up to 10 loans at any one point in time from your available credit limit.
Insufficient credit limit: You do not have sufficient credit limit to borrow a loan.
Borrowing of a loan is in progress: You may have a loan that is pending
Balance-To-Income (BTI): Your total interest-bearing outstanding balance on all unsecured credit facilities across all banks in Singapore exceeds the industry-wide borrowing limit for 3 consecutive months. To find out more about BTI, refer

.
60 days past due: Any one of your loan was unpaid for 60 days past the due date.
The bank reserves the right to suspend the borrowing of loans for any other reasons.

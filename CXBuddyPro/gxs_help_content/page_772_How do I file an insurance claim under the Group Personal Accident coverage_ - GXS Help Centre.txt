================================================================================

Please be informed that Singlife must be given written notice of any claims for accidental injury within 30 days of the date of the accident. Any written notice given by or on behalf of you (as the Insured Member) containing sufficient particulars for Singlife to identify you is considered sufficient notice.  If the notice is not given to Singlife within the requisite time (within 30 days of the date of the accident), Singlife may  accept submission of a claim if it can be shown that it was not reasonably possible to give such notice and that notice was given to Singlife as soon as it was reasonably possible.
If you have a GXS Invest account and would like to file an insurance claim, do follow these steps:
Step 1: Submit all claims forms and supporting documents to
managed_care3@singlife.com
within the 30 days of the date of the accident. The relevant claim forms can be downloaded from
https://singlife.com/en/claims/emplo...surance-claims
Singlife will require any or all of the following:
1) Certificates, medical reports, information and evidence in such form and nature as Singlife may prescribe;
2) Evidence to establish the continuing health condition of the Insured Member;
3) That the Insured Member be available for examination by Singlife’s approved Registered Medical Practitioner when required and if the Insured Member is residing outside Singapore, Singlife may still require him to come to Singapore for such medical examination;
4) Proof of the Insured Member’s date of birth
For processing of a claim for death as a result of Accidental Injury, Singlife has  the right to require an autopsy to be performed provided that such autopsy is not forbidden by law.
Kindly note this will be at your own cost.
Step 2:  Singlife will validate with GXS Bank whether you held any investments with GXS Bank on the date of the accident.
Step 3: Once Singlife has assessed and confirmed your eligibility and approved your claim, the benefits will be paid directly to you (or your legal representative) via a cheque by Singlife.

Here’s an overview of the reporting process so you know what to expect. There are two steps to take when there’s a suspected fraud or scam:
Suspend your account
You can suspend your account immediately through our voice automated system or speak to one of our agents via call or Live Chat. After your account has been suspended, our agent will ask you for details such as the date and time of the incident. To suspend your account via our voice automated system,
1. Call us at GXS Hotline: 1800 866 6685 or (+65) 6866 6685 (from overseas).
2. Press 1 and verify your NRIC and date of birth. Your account will be suspended immediately.
Lodge a police report
To file a police report, you can either:
File it online: The SPF has an e-services portal where you can file certain types of reports online. Just go to their website and look for the "e-Report" section.
Call the SPF Hotline: For urgent matters that need immediate police attention, you can SMS 70999 or call '999'. For non-urgent matters, you can call '1800-255-0000'. They will advise you on the next steps, which might include filing a report in person.
Visit a police station: Head to your nearest Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC) or Police Divisional Headquarters. The officers there will assist you with taking your report.
You may not have lost money, but this is important if you’ve given your personal information to anyone claiming to be from GXS Bank via call, links, or email. Our agent will follow up with an email to request for the police report.

================================================================================

Unfortunately, you won't be able to. But here is what you can do instead:
Repay your outstanding loan(s).
Borrow a new loan with the new repayment date and loan tenure.
Make sure to keep track of your new repayment date and stay on top of your repayments to avoid late interest charges or penalties.
Do note that the above applies to both Instalment Loans and Balance Transfer loans. However, as you can currently only take a Balance Transfer loan once, please note that once you have repaid it in full, you will not be able to take another Balance Transfer loan.

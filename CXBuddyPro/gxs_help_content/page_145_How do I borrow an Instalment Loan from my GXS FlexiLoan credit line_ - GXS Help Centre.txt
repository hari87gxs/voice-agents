================================================================================

Here are the steps to borrow an Instalment Loan:
Open your GXS Bank app. On your GXS FlexiLoan home screen, tap on 'Borrow'.
Select ‘Instalment Loan’ on the top bar. You may tap on the ‘change’ icon to change your loan type.
Key in the amount you need.
Select the tenure of your loan.
If this is your first loan, you can choose the date which you prefer to pay monthly e.g. 15th of each month.
Name your loan (to indicate its purpose!).
Select where you’d like to transfer your loan to.
Review the transfer details and click 'Confirm'.
However, before borrowing an Instalment Loan, you'll need to have a third-party bank account linked to your PayNow, via mobile number and/or NRIC. You can choose to transfer funds into a third-party bank account via PayNow held in your own name.

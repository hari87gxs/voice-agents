================================================================================

Balance Transfer one-time processing fee is calculated as a percentage of your loan principal. The one-time processing fee forms part of the loan amount payable over the selected tenure.
It will be deducted from the amount you have chosen to borrow. From there, the remaining amount will be disbursed to your selected PayNow account.
For example:
Loan Principal = Amount requested by you
= S$10,000
Processing fee percentage = 1.35%
Processing fee amount = Processing fee percentage x Loan Principal
= 1.35% x S$10,000
= S$135

GXS is all about challenging conventions because we know that banking can be made better. But we also know we’re not the only ones out there challenging conventions! GXS Betterzine gives us an opportunity to shine a spotlight on inspiring individuals who have taken the path less travelled and innovative ideas that challenge the status quo across a variety of areas.
If you are only interested in finance-related stories, we regularly add to this under the “Money Matters” category in GXS Betterzine.

================================================================================

No, you don’t have to deposit the S$10,000 as a single lump sum amount.
You have the flexibility to deposit the S$10,000 in smaller increments. As long as you deposit a total of S$10,000 in fresh funds between 20 January and 28 February 2025, and are among the first 500 customers, you will be eligible to participate in the GXS Business Banking CNY2025 Cashback Campaign.

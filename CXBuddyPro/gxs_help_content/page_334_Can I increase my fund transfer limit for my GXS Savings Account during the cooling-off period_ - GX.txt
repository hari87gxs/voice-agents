================================================================================

You will not be able to increase your daily transfer limit during the 12-hour cooling-off period.
The cooling-off period is a security measure designed to prevent unauthorised changes to your daily transfer limits or personal information. You’ll need to wait until the cooling-off period has elapsed before increasing your transaction limit.

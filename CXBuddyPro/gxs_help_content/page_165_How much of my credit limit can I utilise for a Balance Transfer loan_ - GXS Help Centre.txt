================================================================================

You will be granted a sub-limit from which you can take a Balance Transfer loan. This sub-limit is a percentage of your GXS FlexiLoan credit limit.
Here's how you can locate the sub-limit on the GXS Bank app:
Open your GXS Bank app. On your GXS FlexiLoan home screen, tap on 'Borrow'.
Tap on the ‘change’ icon, there you will see the Balance Transfer limit which you can borrow your loan from.

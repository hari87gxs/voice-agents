================================================================================

A scheduled transfer is a feature in the GXS Bank app that allows users to set up automatic money transfers at specific times. These transfers can be set for a one-time event or recurring intervals, like daily, weekly, biweekly, or monthly.
At the moment, scheduled outgoing transfers can only be made using FAST and PayNow.

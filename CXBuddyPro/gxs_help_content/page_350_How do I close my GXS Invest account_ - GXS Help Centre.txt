================================================================================

Before closing your GXS Invest account, please ensure that you have sold all your existing investment units. Also, you will not be able to reinstate or reapply for a GXS Invest Account once you've closed your account.
We also encourage you to download all/any monthly statements as you may no longer be able to access your previous statements once your account is closed.
Once you've done this, reach out to us to close your GXS Invest account via:
- GXS Bank app, Help Centre: GXS Chat

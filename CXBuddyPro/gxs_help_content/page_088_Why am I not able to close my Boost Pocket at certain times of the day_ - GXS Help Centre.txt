================================================================================

Due to service maintenance, closure of Boost Pockets will not be available from 11:45pm to 2:00am daily. We seek your understanding to try again outside these timings.
Do note as well, that if you had previously requested to withdraw your Boost Pocket funds upon maturity, or did not instruct us to renew your Boost Pocket, the money will be credited to your Main Account after 2:00am of the maturity date.

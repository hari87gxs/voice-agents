================================================================================

Balance Transfer can only be taken once, unless otherwise allocated by the bank.
Do note that in combination with Instalment Loans, you can only borrow up to 10 loans at any one point in time from your available credit.
This means that if you have already taken 10 Instalment Loans, you will not be able to take a Balance Transfer until you have fully repaid at least 1 Instalment Loan.

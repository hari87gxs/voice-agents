Unfortunately, we may have encountered an error while processing your order. When this happens, we will initiate a refund of the purchase amount to your GXS Savings Account, following which, you may choose to place a new buy order again.
Please ensure that your total balance (including any refunds and interest accruals) does not exceed the maximum balance amount that you can hold in your GXS Savings Account.
View the status of your Buy order by tapping ‘Transactions’ on the GXS Invest home screen and selecting the relevant Buy order.

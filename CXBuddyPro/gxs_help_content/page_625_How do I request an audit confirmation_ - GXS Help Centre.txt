================================================================================

You can request an audit confirmation "Submit an enquiry" via the Help Centre on the GXS Bank app. Only the authorised person can make this request.
To submit your request, provide:
Date for the audit confirmation.
Name and email address of your auditor.
(Optional) Auditor’s reference number.
Once processed, the confirmation report will be emailed to you. The report is password-protected, so ensure you share the password with your auditor.
Requests might be rejected if it is not from the authorised user, or if duplicate requests are made for the same period. If there’s a problem, you’ll be notified.

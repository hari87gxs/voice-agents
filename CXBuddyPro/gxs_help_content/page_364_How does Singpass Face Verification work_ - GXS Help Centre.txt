The process of Singpass Face Verification involves several steps to ensure the security and accuracy of identity authentication.
During the verification process, users are prompted to take a live photo using their device's camera. This photo is then compared against the government's records (CPF Board).
Do note that it is important to have the Singpass app installed on your device in order to use the face verification feature.

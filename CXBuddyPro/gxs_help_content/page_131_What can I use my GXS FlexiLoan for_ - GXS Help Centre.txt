================================================================================

GXS FlexiLoan is a credit line that allows you to borrow up to 10 loans from your available credit limit. No interest nor fees will be charged if you do not borrow a loan from the credit line.
Based on your needs, there are 2 types of loans you can take:
Instalment Loan
If you prefer to manage your budget with equal monthly payments over a longer period, then this is the loan for you.
Select a loan tenure of 2 - 60 months (as assigned by the bank)
Interest from as low as 2.88% p.a. (EIR 5.45% p.a.) or any rate assigned by the bank. No fees at all!
Repay early and enjoy interest savings
Possible uses: Support your financial goals, business needs, renovation, education, managing multiple outstanding balances with a single facility etc.
Balance Transfer
Conserve cash by making smaller repayments each month over a shorter period. Minimum monthly repayment could be as low as 1% of your loan principal (or at such other rate as stipulated by the bank)
Select a loan tenure of 4 - 12 months (as assigned by the bank) and repay the remaining outstanding only at the end of the loan tenure
Enjoy 0% interest with a one-time processing fee (EIR 4.13% p.a.)
Do note that you can take a Balance Transfer only once, unless otherwise allocated by the bank.
Possible uses: Support your financial goals, emergencies, short-term business cash-flow cycles, managing multiple outstanding balances with a single facility etc.

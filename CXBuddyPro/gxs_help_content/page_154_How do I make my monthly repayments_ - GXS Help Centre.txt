On your GXS FlexiLoan home screen, select 'Manage'
Tap 'Get Account Details', and you’ll see your GXS beneficiary name, account number, bank name, bank code, and branch code
Log in to your third-party bank account
In that bank account, key in your GXS FlexiLoan account details to save your GXS FlexiLoan account as a payee. You’re good to go!
Pro tip

On your GXS FlexiLoan home screen, tap on 'Quick Pay Due'
Select to repay with your 'GXS Savings Account' or 'Other Bank'
Review your repayment details and follow the on-screen instructions
Do note that any overdue loan amounts you have will need to be cleared before you can repay other loans.

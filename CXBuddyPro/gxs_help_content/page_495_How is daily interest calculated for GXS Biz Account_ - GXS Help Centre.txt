================================================================================

You earn interest daily based on the balance of your GXS Biz Account at the end of each day. Interest earned on the account balance is 1.08% per annum.
We multiply your balance by the interest rate per annum over 365 days. Interest will be credited to your account when you earn at least S$0.01 in accumulated interest.
For example, based on an interest rate of 1.08% per annum applicable on balances in your GXS Biz Account:
On 2 August 2025, your balance in your GXS Biz Account is S$40,000. You will earn an accrued interest of S$1.18356.
S$1.18 will be credited to your account on 3 August 2025 morning. Your balance will now be S$40,001.18. The remaining S$0.00356 will continue to accrue the next day

================================================================================

The performance of your investments will be reflected in the ‘Current value’ and ‘Total returns’ with fluctuations in the unit price reflecting both increases and decreases in value.
Please note that if your total investment amount is relatively small, you may not notice changes in your 'Current Value' on a day to day basis.

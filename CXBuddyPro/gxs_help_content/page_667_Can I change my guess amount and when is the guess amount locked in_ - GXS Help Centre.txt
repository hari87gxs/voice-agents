================================================================================

Yes, you can change your guess amount anytime during the guess period by depositing more funds or withdrawing funds from your Saving Pocket.
Your guess amount will be locked based on the day end balance on the last day of the month, less any interest credited.
You will then have to hold the fresh funds amount for the hold period of 1 month. Winners of the Grand Prize will be announced on the 30th day of the next month.

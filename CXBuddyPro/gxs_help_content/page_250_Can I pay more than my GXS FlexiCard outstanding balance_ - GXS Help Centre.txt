================================================================================

Yes, you may choose to pay more than the outstanding balance. You can also make payment earlier than the stated due date.
Should you decide to overpay your GXS FlexiCard account, do note that only a maximum excess balance of S$500 is allowed. This excess balance of S$500 is on top of the S$500 credit limit provided to you.
Any excess balance will be used to offset your following month’s statement and it is also non-transferable to other GXS accounts.

No, interest credited will not be included in your guess amount. Only the nett amount - the total amount you deposited minus the total amount you withdrew during the guess period will be considered your final guess amount.
For e.g. you deposit S$5,000.00 on 5 April, withdraw S$1,000.00 on 20 April and earn interest of S$8.00 for the month.
At the end of the day of 30 April, your guess amount will be S$5,000.00 minus S$1,000.00 = S$4,000.00.

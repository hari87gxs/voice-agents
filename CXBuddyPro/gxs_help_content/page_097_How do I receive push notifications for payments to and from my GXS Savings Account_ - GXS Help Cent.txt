================================================================================

When you sign up with us, the GXS Bank app would have prompted you to allow push notifications from the app. When there is a payment to your GXS Savings Account, you will receive an email and a push notification. You will still receive an email even if you do not allow push notifications.
To turn on push notifications,
On the GXS Bank app home screen, tap on 'Me'.
Click 'Notifications and emails'.
Toggle on to receive notifications from us :)

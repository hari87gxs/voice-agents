================================================================================

We're sad to see you go! Do note that the closure is permanent, and you will not be able to reinstate or reapply for GXS FlexiLoan Biz again once you have closed the account.
Before closing your GXS FlexiLoan Biz account, please ensure that all your loans have been fully repaid. We also encourage you to download all/any monthly statements as you may no longer be able to access the GXS Bank app once your account is closed.
Once that's done, reach out to our Customer Support Team for the closure via:
GXS app, Help Centre: GXS Chat (Recommended)
GXS app, Help Centre: Submit an enquiry
GXS Hotline: 1800 866 6685 or (+65) 6866 6685 (from overseas)

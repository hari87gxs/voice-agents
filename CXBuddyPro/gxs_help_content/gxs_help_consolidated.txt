Another reason could be that your mobile device is connected to a Virtual Private Network (VPN). To re-apply for a GXS Savings Account, you’ll need to disable your VPN before we are able to process your application. You can turn it back on thereafter.

Scraped: 2025-11-28T01:07:32.930769

================================================================================

First, check if you’re using the right Singpass login. You should only be accessing the GXS Bank app with your own Singpass credentials.
Here are some troubleshooting guide to help you along:
Check your internet connection to ensure it's stable
Ensure your device operating system and GXS Bank app are updated to the latest version. The latest version of GXS Bank app is available on both Apple Store and Google Play Store
Ensure that you did not block all cookies in your browser settings
It is possible you may be accessing Singpass login during a maintenance period, which prevents you from logging in to your GXS accounts successfully. Refer
here
for MyInfo maintenance schedule.
To resolve any Singpass login issues, you may contact
Singpass Helpdesk
directly.
If you’ve changed your NRIC number or are still facing issues, contact us at:

================================================================================

As an account holder, you have a duty to protect access or access codes to your account, report unauthorised transactions, provide information on unauthorised transactions, or make a police report if requested.
You will not be liable for any loss arising from an unauthorised transaction if the loss resulted from any act or omission by us, or any action or omission of any independent third party (if such loss does not exceed S$1,000), provided that you have complied with the above duties.
You will be liable for the actual loss arising from an unauthorised transaction where your recklessness was the primary cause of the loss. Recklessness would include your failure to comply with the above duties.
In all cases, we will assess and resolve claims in a fair and reasonable manner.
For full details of your duties, please refer to MAS E-payments User Protection Guidelines at www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/guidelines/guidelines-for-e-payments-user-protection

Scraped: 2025-11-28T01:08:09.885551

================================================================================

An unauthorised transaction refers to a payment transaction initiated by any person without your knowledge and consent. Such a transaction may be a transaction you don't recognise or was not made by you.
An erroneous transaction refers to a payment transaction from any account to the wrong recipient. Such a transaction may have been initiated by you and paid to the wrong person, or initiated by someone else and paid to you. This can happen if the wrong payment details (e.g. account number, phone number or NRIC) are keyed in during the transfer.

Lodge a police report
To file a police report, you can either:
File it online: The SPF has an e-services portal where you can file certain types of reports online. Just go to their website and look for the "e-Report" section.
Call the SPF Hotline: For urgent matters that need immediate police attention, you can SMS 70999 or call '999'. For non-urgent matters, you can call '1800-255-0000'. They will advise you on the next steps, which might include filing a report in person.
Visit a police station: Head to your nearest Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC) or Police Divisional Headquarters. The officers there will assist you with taking your report.
You may not have lost money, but this is important if you’ve given your personal information to anyone claiming to be from GXS Bank via call, links, or email. Our agent will follow up with an email to request for the police report.

Accessibility services are a feature offered on Android devices and is designed to assist users with disabilities or who are temporarily unable to fully interact with their device by allowing an additional and/or alternative interface feedback.
Apps that are not from trusted or official app stores with accessibility service permission enabled on your devices could allow hackers to tap this feature and gain access to your devices.
An app with these permissions enabled will have almost full control over the device. With the right accessibility permissions granted, the hacker can grant him or herself additional permissions and activate your device’s camera and the microphone, capture screenshots, start screen recordings or live stream your screen. They will also be able to install and uninstall any app on your device.

Scraped: 2025-11-28T01:09:48.043870

================================================================================

We will be rolling out the enhanced security measures from 17 November 2023.
Here's a look at what's going to happen. From 17 to 30 November 2023, your GXS Bank app will alert you when potential security vulnerabilities are detected on your device. You are strongly encouraged to remove those vulnerabilities immediately to ensure that your device and data is safe. During this period, you will still be able to access your GXS Bank app at your own risk. Do note that in the case of confirmed malware being detected, you will need to remove those malicious apps to proceed.
But from 1 December 2023 onwards, if security vulnerabilities remain detected on your device, you will no longer be able to access your GXS Bank app.
To ensure you have the latest security measures, always update your GXS Bank app to the latest version!

================================================================================

Your GXS Savings Account is made up of your Main Account, Saving Pocket(s) and Boost Pocket, which can be added to the home screen of your GXS Bank app.
Your Main Account is for your regular transactions, and you can create up to 8 Saving Pockets for your saving goals. Just remember that you can only transfer funds from your Saving Pockets to and from your Main Account.
You may also lock your funds away in a Boost Pocket to earn base + bonus interest rates.
If you need to use your funds urgently, you can close your Boost Pocket before the lock-in period is over, earn the base interest to date and forfeit the bonus interest. You will need to fund your Boost Pocket from your Main Account during creation, and the funds from your Boost Pocket will return to your Main Account upon closure.

Scraped: 2025-11-28T01:10:34.142917

================================================================================

You earn interest daily based on the aggregate balance of your Main Account and Saving Pocket(s) at the end of each day. Interest earned on the balance for each Saving Pocket is 1.18% p.a., and 1.08% p.a. for your Main Account. We multiply your balance by the interest rate per annum over 365 days. Interest will be credited to your account when you earn at least S$0.01 in accumulated interest.
For example, based on an interest rate of 1.18% p.a. applicable on balances in your Saving Pockets,
On 30 July 2025, your balance in your Saving Pocket(s) is S$20,000. You will earn an accrued interest of S$0.64657.
S$0.64 will be credited to your account on the morning of 31 July 2025. Your balance will then be S$20,000.64. The remaining S$0.00657 will continue to accrue the next day.

================================================================================

Definitely! The funds in your GXS Savings Account will continue to earn interest even after you’ve hit your maximum balance amount.
Here is an example, based on an interest rate of 1.08% per annum:
On 20 June 2025, your balance in your Saving Pocket(s) is S$95,000 at the end of the day. You will earn an interest of S$2.81 and it will be credited to your account on 21 June 2025. Your account balance on 21 June 2025 is now S$95,002.81. You will continue to earn interest based on this S$95,002.81 amount at the end of the day.
For your information, your deposits with GXS are aggregated and insured up to S$100,000 by the Singapore Deposit Insurance Corporation (SDIC).

Follow these simple steps to find out this maximum balance amount for your GXS Savings Account:

================================================================================

Losing a loved one is not easy. Please reach out to us for guidance on how to manage your loved one’s GXS account. These are the steps you can take:
Apply for the legal documents to manage their account
Request for their asset information (optional)
Request to close their account
Getting the right legal documents depends on whether your loved one has left a will
If your loved one has left a will, and you are appointed in the will as the Executor of the estate, apply for a Grant of Probate.
If you are not able to find a will, or you know that your loved one has not left a will, apply for a Grant of Letters of Administration. You may wish to engage a lawyer to help you with the application.
Both Grants are court orders that will allow for the administration of your loved one’s estate.
For an estate worth under S$3 million, you can apply to the Family Justice Court. For an estate worth over S$3 million, apply to the Family Division of the High Court.
If your loved one’s estate is worth less than S$50,000, with or without a will, you may consider applying to the Public Trustee. The Public Trustee’s Office may assist with the distribution of the assets without a Grant.
To request for your kin’s asset information, please submit these documents to us:
Digital death certificate from the My Legacy portal
Identity document of notifier or personal representative
Proof of relationship (e.g. marriage certificate, birth certificate)
Originating Summons for Grant of Probate or Grant of Letters of Administration
To close your loved one’s account, please submit the following:
Death certificate of your loved one (e.g. digital death certificate from the My Legacy portal)
Grant of Probate or Grant of Letters of Administration
Identity document of Executor or Administrator of the estate, as named in the Grant
Proof of bank account details (to release the kin’s funds)
Note: If you are submitting copies of original documents, please ensure that the copies are certified true copies of original documents by a Notary Public or a practising Advocate & Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore.

================================================================================

The regulatory requirements has placed a borrowing limit on the amount of unsecured credit that can be granted to borrowers across all banks in Singapore.
This is to ensure that borrowers do not take up too much debt beyond their means to repay.
What is the borrowing limit on unsecured credit?
This limit is defined as Balance-To-Income (BTI) ratio. BTI ratio is calculated by taking your total unsecured interest-bearing outstanding balances across all financial institutions or corporations related to financial institutions in Singapore and dividing it by your monthly income. The industry-wide borrowing limit is currently set at 12x of monthly income and is applicable to borrowers with annual income less than S$120,000.
What does my total unsecured interest-bearing outstanding debt include?
Total outstanding debt includes debt across all financial institutions and corporations related to financial institutions. For purposes of calculating your BTI ratio, only interest-bearing unsecured debt needs to be included.
This includes not only your outstanding balance on GXS unsecured lending products (e.g. GXS FlexiLoan) but also your interest-bearing outstanding balance with other financial institutions. Examples of interest-bearing outstanding balances could be amounts charged to credit cards that are not repaid in full by the due date, interest accruing unsecured personal loans or credit lines, or late interest on an otherwise interest-free loan. If you have a Grab Partner Cash Advance (PCA) loan, the outstanding balances are included as well.
If your BTI ratio exceeds 12x of your monthly income for 3 consecutive months, your GXS FlexiLoan account will be suspended from further borrowings. At the moment, you will not be able to unblock your account once it is suspended.

================================================================================

The interest payable component forms part of your Equal Monthly Instalment (EMI) amount, which is reflected in-app in your repayment schedule. For example,
Annual Percentage Rate (APR): 3% p.a.
Effective Interest Rate (EIR): 5.69% p.a.
Tenure: 3 years
Borrowed loan amount: S$10,000
Total interest payable = Loan * APR * tenure
= S$10,000 * 3% / 365 * (365 * 3 years)
= S$900
EMI amount = (interest payable + principal) / tenure
= (S$900 + S$10,000) / 36 months
= S$302.78
Your monthly repayment amount over the 3 year tenure will therefore be S$302.78.
*The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) represents the total borrowing cost, expressed as a yearly rate, relative to the initial loan amount.
The Effective Interest Rate (EIR) is the rate that reflects the true cost of borrowing and takes into account total charges. It's computed over a reducing balance basis and accrued daily.

Interest is calculated on a daily, non-compounding basis. You can check your total interest saved upon entering your repayment amount.
If an early repayment is made, it will be deducted from your outstanding GXS FlexiLoan balance on that day, resulting in interest savings for you as interest is calculated on a reduced outstanding balance instead. The interest amount that you saved will be shown in your GXS Bank app during the repayment process.
We recommend taking out a loan only when necessary and with careful consideration. GXS FlexiLoan is designed to provide flexibility and support during unexpected situations. While early repayment is possible with interest savings and at no fees, we advise against taking out loans that are not truly needed. The bank conducts periodic reviews to ensure that our customers are using our products responsibly and with prudence.

================================================================================

Interest is calculated on a daily non-compounding basis. This means that the interest is charged on your outstanding GXS FlexiLoan balance each day.
To calculate the interest payable across your loan tenure when you first take a loan - For example, if you took a loan of S$10,000 with a tenure of 3 years:
Annual Percentage Rate (APR): 3% p.a.
Effective Interest Rate (EIR): 5.69% p.a.
Tenure: 3 years
Borrowed loan amount: S$10,000
Total interest payable = Loan * APR * tenure
= S$10,000 * 3% / 365 * (365 * 3 years)
= S$900
*The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) represents the total borrowing cost, expressed as a yearly rate, relative to the initial loan amount.
The Effective Interest Rate (EIR) is the rate that reflects the true cost of borrowing and takes into account total charges. It's computed over a reducing balance basis and accrued daily.

================================================================================

You can easily simulate the monthly amount payable when you go through the borrowing journey on the GXS Bank app.
A minimum percentage of the loan principal will need to be paid each month - you can refer to your app for the minimum percentage payable. The remaining balance will then be payable by the end of the tenure.
The one-time processing fee forms part of the loan amount payable over the selected tenure.
For example:
Interest (APR): 0%
Selected tenure: 4 months
One time processing fee: 1.35% (EIR 4.13%)
Minimum percentage payable each month except for final month: 1%
Loan Principal = Amount requested by you
= $10,000
Monthly repayment each month except for final month = Loan Principal x Minimum percentage payable
= $10,000 x 1%
= $100
Amount payable in final month = Loan Principal - [Monthly repayment each month x (Tenure - 1)]
= $10,000 - [$100 x (4 - 1)]
= $10,000 - $300
= $9,700
This means that your repayment schedule is as follows:
Month 1: $100
Month 2: $100
Month 3: $100
Month 4: $9,700
*The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) represents the total borrowing cost, expressed as a yearly rate, relative to the initial loan amount.

Just like Instalment Loans, there are no early repayment fees, no annual fees and no late fees. However, while there are no late fees, late interest is chargeable if the monthly repayment is not made on time.

The new Instalment Loan principal amount will be the remaining outstanding balance of your Balance Transfer Loan. Depending on the loan tenure you selected for your conversion, we will compute a new monthly instalment amount for you. Your prevailing GXS FlexiLoan interest rate will apply to the converted Instalment Loan.
Illustration
On 1 January 2024, a GXS FlexiLoan - Balance Transfer Loan of $10,000 was taken for a 6 month tenure at a minimum monthly due rate of 1%. Table 1 shows how your loan schedule may look like.
A month before your final repayment due date on 1 July 2024, you realise you may need more time to repay your outstanding balance of $9,500 - this outstanding amount of S$9,500 can then be converted into an Instalment Loan to split the repayment into more manageable monthly repayments. You have the choice of tenure for the Instalment Loan.
Once converted, your prevailing GXS FlexiLoan interest rate will apply to the Instalment Loan. Assuming you selected a 3 month tenure and your GXS FlexiLoan interest rate is APR 2.99% p.a. (EIR 4.50% p.a.). Table 2 shows how your new loan schedule may look like.
Split date: 1 June 2024
Monthly repayment date: 1st day of month
Split Instalment Loan principal: S$9,500
Loan tenure: 3 months
Interest amount payable: 2.99% p.a. for 3 months = S$71.60
Total loan payable: S$9,500 + S$71.60 = S$9,571.60
Equal Monthly Instalment payable: S$9,571.60 / 3 = S$3,190.53

By converting your final Balance Transfer Loan repayment amount, your repayment period will be further extended for a period of time. This can also help you avoid late interest charges and better manage your financial obligations.
Psst … note that the first instalment payable on your converted Instalment Loan is as soon as one month from the date which you choose to split your Balance Transfer Loan.
For example, you requested a split of your Balance Transfer Loan on 1 June 2024. Your first instalment payable for the converted Instalment Loan may start as early as 1 July 2024.

================================================================================

A 'split' of your Balance Transfer Loan allows you to convert your outstanding Balance Transfer Loan into an Instalment Loan; essentially splitting your remaining Balance Transfer Loan outstanding into bite-sized equal monthly repayments.
This is especially useful when you are nearing the final repayment of your Balance Transfer Loan, which tends to be a relatively larger amount. By converting your final Balance Transfer Loan repayment amount, your repayment period will be further extended for a period of time.
But hurry! This must be done before the final repayment date of your Balance Transfer Loan. You can choose to activate this ‘split’ feature anytime before your Balance Transfer Loan expires as long as none of your loans are overdue and your Balance Transfer Loan outstanding balance is at least S$200.

If you miss a repayment on your new Instalment Loan, late interest charges will be applicable. These charges vary based on how late your repayments are.
Pro-tip: It is crucial to make timely repayments to avoid any negative impact on your credit score.
Late interest charges has been increased from 18% p.a. to 28% p.a., chargeable from 3 days past the repayment date. The 2 day grace period will continue to remain in effect. This has taken effect on 1 November 2024.

Once your Balance Transfer Loan is split, it will be closed and a new Instalment Loan will be opened with the remaining outstanding Balance Transfer Loan amount as the principal amount. The terms of the new loan, including the interest rate and repayment schedule, will be provided to you before the conversion is finalised.
Note that the first instalment payable on your converted Instalment Loan is as soon as one month from the date which you choose to split your Balance Transfer Loan.
For example, you requested a split of your Balance Transfer Loan on 1 June 2024. Your first instalment payable for the converted Instalment Loan will start in July 2024.

The principal amount of your new Instalment Loan is based on the remaining outstanding balance of your Balance Transfer Loan. Only the full outstanding Balance Transfer Loan amount can be split into an Instalment Loan, you will not be able to select a partial amount. If you would like to convert a smaller amount, we suggest repaying a portion of your Balance Transfer first.
Interest payable will be calculated using your prevailing GXS FlexiLoan interest rate and the repayment period based on the tenure you select for your new Instalment Loan.

================================================================================

We understand that every cent matters! When you tap your GXS Debit Card at the gantry, a $0.10 pre-authorisation charge is made to ensure your card is active and ready. Not to worry, this isn't your actual fare and it'll be promptly returned once the final transaction details from SimplyGo come in.
If for any reason the $0.10 charge fails, fret not! You can approach the staff at the MRT station for further assistance. Alternatively, you can also top up your GXS Saving Account's Main Account and give it another go. Once the $0.10 pre-authorisation is done, you should be able to exit by tapping your card at the gantry.

================================================================================

We're here to make your Bus / MRT rides smooth and worry-free! Your fare is calculated based on your journey, and it's deducted only when you exit a gantry. Under SimplyGo, your rides are bundled together and a final transaction is made either when you've clocked $15 in fares or after five days of rides, whichever comes first.
If your GXS Savings Account's Main Account does not have enough to cover a ride or a transaction, it's okay! Your account will go into negative balance, meaning it goes below zero. We've got no penalties for that. Please top up your account at the soonest to ensure there is sufficient funds for future purchases.

Since the settlement is initiated by the merchant, the settlement date can occur anytime from a few days to several weeks after your transaction date.
From the time of your transaction until the settlement date, there will be a hold on your card's credit limit for the transaction amount. This hold will reduce your available credit limit and will remain in place until the settlement date.

Your bus/MRT fare is calculated based on your journey, and it's deducted only when you exit a gantry. Under SimplyGo, your rides are bundled together and a final transaction is made either when you've clocked S$15 in fares or after five days of rides, whichever comes first.
If your GXS FlexiCard does not have sufficient credit limit to cover a ride or transaction, your account may go into overlimit state. Please make payment to your card account immediately.

================================================================================

When you tap your GXS FlexiCard on the fare gantry, a S$0.10 pre-authorisation charge is made to ensure your card is active and ready. Don't worry, this isn't your actual fare. It will be promptly returned once the final transaction details from SimplyGo are processed.
If the S$0.10 charge is unsuccessful for any reason, don't fret! You can approach the staff at the MRT station for assistance. Alternatively, you can make a payment to your GXS FlexiCard and try again. Once the S$0.10 pre-authorisation is successful, you should be able to exit by tapping your card on the fare gantry.

If more than or equal to S$15 - minimum payment amount will be S$15.
Once the above is calculated, the below charges (if any) will be added to form the total minimum payment:
2.  Overdue principal (if any).
3.  Fees accrued eg. flexi fee, late fee, annual fee (if any).
4.  Overlimit amount (if any) will be added to your current statement's minimum payment amount.

Title: What is the 28-day annualized yield and how is it calculated? In addition, how does the 28-day annualized yield differ from the fund’s historical return? - GXS Help Centre

Scraped: 2025-11-28T02:07:04.537436
Word Count: 234
Is FAQ Answer: True

================================================================================

The published yield is calculated by annualizing the last 28 dealing days average Net Asset Value (NAV). The formula is as follows:
28-day annualized yield =
(NAV on T+28 - NAV on T / NAV on T) / Number of Calendar Days * 365 * 100%
This yield can help you gauge the fund’s yield based on the fund’s average NAV over the last 28 dealing days. However, past performance of an investment does not necessarily reflect its future performance, so the yield does not represent the fund’s future or actual returns and should be used for reference purposes only. The value of investments and investment returns (including dividends, distributions, income or other returns) may rise or fall.
The 28-day annualised yield is a gauge of the fund’s yield based on the fund’s average NAV over the last 28 dealing days, and does not represent the actual of future performance of the fund. It is calculated and refreshed every day and will fluctuate depending on the underlying instruments within the fund.
The fund’s historical return is based on actual past NAVs and shows how the fund has performed across a period of time.
You may refer to the fund factsheet for the latest updated performance via the following steps:
1. Log in to the GXS Bank app.
2. Tap on 'GXS Invest'.
3. Tap on 'More'.
4. Scroll down and tap 'View Fact Sheet'.

No, interest credited will not be included in your guess amount. Only the nett amount - the total amount you deposited minus the total amount you withdrew during the guess period will be considered your final guess amount.
For e.g. you deposit S$5,000.00 on 5 April, withdraw S$1,000.00 on 20 April and earn interest of S$8.00 for the month.
At the end of the day of 30 April, your guess amount will be S$5,000.00 minus S$1,000.00 = S$4,000.00.

The issuance of GrabCoins are based on the currency charges on Grab and converted into Singapore Dollars (SGD) based on the following exchange rates, which are fixed and used throughout this campaign period to award GrabCoins:
Example of how it works:
When John spends MYR20 on a Grab ride in Malaysia with his GXS Debit Card, here’s how his rewards are calculated:
Exchange rate: SGD to MYR exchange rate is fixed at 3.3294
Currency Conversion: MYR20 ÷ 3.3294 = SGD6.01.
Reward Rate: 2% of SGD6.01 is equivalent to 60 GrabCoins (≈ SGD 0.12); as every 500 GrabCoins you earn can be used to offset S$1 of your purchases.
The exchange rates above only apply for awarding GrabCoins under this Campaign. Mastercard exchange rates will apply for GXS Debit Card transactions.

We have recently enhanced the security measures on the GXS Bank app. To ensure that our app remains secure and equipped with the latest features, you will need to update your phone operating system (OS) by 15 December 2024.
Please consider the following options:
Upgrade your phone’s OS: Check your device settings for available updates and install the latest version (minimum version supported: iOS 14 and Android 8)
Consider switching to a new device: Upgrade to a new phone that supports the latest and most secure OS.
Do note: Phones that are running on OS versions lower than those stated above will no longer be supported by the bank.
In addition to safeguarding your data and credentials, the GXS Bank app will not run on a rooted, jailbroken device or on non-generally available platforms (e.g. private developer beta and public beta).

If you're unable to roll back the update, you can log in to the GXS Bank app using another phone. This will however, require you to re-authenticate your identity.

Check Lighting and Visibility:
Ensure that your face is well-lit and clearly visible. Poor lighting conditions can interfere with the face recognition process.
Remove any accessories that might obscure your face, such as sunglasses, hats, or masks. These can prevent the system from getting a clear view of your face features.

Make sure your device's camera is functioning properly. Clean the camera lens to ensure there are no smudges or dirt affecting the image quality.
Verify that your camera is not damaged and is capable of capturing clear images.

There are several steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:
Check Lighting and Visibility:
Ensure that your face is well-lit and clearly visible. Poor lighting conditions can interfere with the face recognition process.
Remove any accessories that might obscure your face, such as sunglasses, hats, or masks. These can prevent the system from getting a clear view of your face features.
Camera Functionality:
Make sure your device's camera is functioning properly. Clean the camera lens to ensure there are no smudges or dirt affecting the image quality.
Verify that your camera is not damaged and is capable of capturing clear images.

The issuance of GrabCoins are based on the currency charges on Grab and converted into Singapore Dollars (SGD) based on the following exchange rates, which are fixed and used throughout this campaign period to award GrabCoins:
Example of how it works:
When John spends MYR20 on a Grab ride in Malaysia with his GXS Debit Card, here’s how his rewards are calculated:
Exchange rate: SGD to MYR exchange rate is fixed at 3.3294
Currency Conversion: MYR20 ÷ 3.3294 = SGD6.01.
Reward Rate: 2% of SGD6.01 is equivalent to 60 GrabCoins (≈ SGD 0.12); as every 500 GrabCoins you earn can be used to offset S$1 of your purchases.
The exchange rates above only apply for awarding GrabCoins under this Campaign. Mastercard exchange rates will apply for GXS Debit Card transactions.

You earn interest daily based on the balance of your GXS Biz Account at the end of each day. Interest earned on the account balance is 1.08% per annum.
We multiply your balance by the interest rate per annum over 365 days. Interest will be credited to your account when you earn at least S$0.01 in accumulated interest.
For example, based on an interest rate of 1.08% per annum applicable on balances in your GXS Biz Account:
On 2 August 2025, your balance in your GXS Biz Account is S$40,000. You will earn an accrued interest of S$1.18356.
S$1.18 will be credited to your account on 3 August 2025 morning. Your balance will now be S$40,001.18. The remaining S$0.00356 will continue to accrue the next day

Suspend your account
You can suspend your account immediately through our voice automated system or speak to one of our agents via call or Live Chat.

Call the SPF Hotline: For urgent matters that need immediate police attention, you can SMS 70999 or call '999'. For non-urgent matters, you can call '1800-255-0000'. They will advise you on the next steps, which might include filing a report in person.
Visit a police station: Head to your nearest Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC) or Police Divisional Headquarters. The officers there will assist you with taking your report.
You may not have lost money, but this is important if you’ve given your personal information to anyone claiming to be from GXS Bank via call, links, or email. Our agent will follow up with an email to request for the police report.

Please be informed that Singlife must be given written notice of any claims for accidental injury within 30 days of the date of the accident. Any written notice given by or on behalf of you (as the Insured Member) containing sufficient particulars for Singlife to identify you is considered sufficient notice.  If the notice is not given to Singlife within the requisite time (within 30 days of the date of the accident), Singlife may  accept submission of a claim if it can be shown that it was not reasonably possible to give such notice and that notice was given to Singlife as soon as it was reasonably possible.
If you have a GXS Invest account and would like to file an insurance claim, do follow these steps:
Step 1: Submit all claims forms and supporting documents to
managed_care3@singlife.com
within the 30 days of the date of the accident. The relevant claim forms can be downloaded from
https://singlife.com/en/claims/emplo...surance-claims
Singlife will require any or all of the following:
1) Certificates, medical reports, information and evidence in such form and nature as Singlife may prescribe;
2) Evidence to establish the continuing health condition of the Insured Member;
3) That the Insured Member be available for examination by Singlife’s approved Registered Medical Practitioner when required and if the Insured Member is residing outside Singapore, Singlife may still require him to come to Singapore for such medical examination;
4) Proof of the Insured Member’s date of birth
For processing of a claim for death as a result of Accidental Injury, Singlife has  the right to require an autopsy to be performed provided that such autopsy is not forbidden by law.
Kindly note this will be at your own cost.
Step 2:  Singlife will validate with GXS Bank whether you held any investments with GXS Bank on the date of the accident.
Step 3: Once Singlife has assessed and confirmed your eligibility and approved your claim, the benefits will be paid directly to you (or your legal representative) via a cheque by Singlife.

Please refer to the respective fund share class factsheet available on Fullerton’s

Check Lighting and Visibility:
Ensure that your face is well-lit and clearly visible. Poor lighting conditions can interfere with the face recognition process.
Remove any accessories that might obscure your face, such as sunglasses, hats, or masks. These can prevent the system from getting a clear view of your face features.
Camera Functionality:
Make sure your device's camera is functioning properly. Clean the camera lens to ensure there are no smudges or dirt affecting the image quality.
Verify that your camera is not damaged and is capable of capturing clear images.

You can suspend your account immediately through our voice automated system or speak to one of our agents via call or Live Chat. After your account has been suspended, our agent will ask you for details such as the date and time of the incident. To suspend your account via our voice automated system,
1. Call us at GXS Hotline: 1800 866 6685 or (+65) 6866 6685 (from overseas).
2. Press 1 and verify your NRIC and date of birth. Your account will be suspended immediately.
Lodge a police report
To file a police report, you can either:
File it online: The SPF has an e-services portal where you can file certain types of reports online. Just go to their website and look for the "e-Report" section.
Call the SPF Hotline: For urgent matters that need immediate police attention, you can SMS 70999 or call '999'. For non-urgent matters, you can call '1800-255-0000'. They will advise you on the next steps, which might include filing a report in person.
Visit a police station: Head to your nearest Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC) or Police Divisional Headquarters. The officers there will assist you with taking your report.
You may not have lost money, but this is important if you’ve given your personal information to anyone claiming to be from GXS Bank via call, links, or email. Our agent will follow up with an email to request for the police report.

Please be informed that Singlife must be given written notice of any claims for accidental injury within 30 days of the date of the accident. Any written notice given by or on behalf of you (as the Insured Member) containing sufficient particulars for Singlife to identify you is considered sufficient notice.  If the notice is not given to Singlife within the requisite time (within 30 days of the date of the accident), Singlife may  accept submission of a claim if it can be shown that it was not reasonably possible to give such notice and that notice was given to Singlife as soon as it was reasonably possible.
If you have a GXS Invest account and would like to file an insurance claim, do follow these steps:
Step 1: Submit all claims forms and supporting documents to
managed_care3@singlife.com
within the 30 days of the date of the accident. The relevant claim forms can be downloaded from
https://singlife.com/en/claims/emplo...surance-claims
Singlife will require any or all of the following:
1) Certificates, medical reports, information and evidence in such form and nature as Singlife may prescribe;
2) Evidence to establish the continuing health condition of the Insured Member;
3) That the Insured Member be available for examination by Singlife’s approved Registered Medical Practitioner when required and if the Insured Member is residing outside Singapore, Singlife may still require him to come to Singapore for such medical examination;
4) Proof of the Insured Member’s date of birth
For processing of a claim for death as a result of Accidental Injury, Singlife has  the right to require an autopsy to be performed provided that such autopsy is not forbidden by law.
Kindly note this will be at your own cost.
Step 2:  Singlife will validate with GXS Bank whether you held any investments with GXS Bank on the date of the accident.
Step 3: Once Singlife has assessed and confirmed your eligibility and approved your claim, the benefits will be paid directly to you (or your legal representative) via a cheque by Singlife.

Class G is available for subscription exclusively through GXS Bank (with the additional feature of complimentary group personal accident insurance cover, underwritten by Singapore Life Ltd.)
Please refer to the respective fund share class factsheet available on Fullerton’s

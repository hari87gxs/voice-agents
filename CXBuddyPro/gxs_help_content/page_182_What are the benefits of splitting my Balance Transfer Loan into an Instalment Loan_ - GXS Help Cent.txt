================================================================================

By converting your final Balance Transfer Loan repayment amount, your repayment period will be further extended for a period of time. This can also help you avoid late interest charges and better manage your financial obligations.
Psst … note that the first instalment payable on your converted Instalment Loan is as soon as one month from the date which you choose to split your Balance Transfer Loan.
For example, you requested a split of your Balance Transfer Loan on 1 June 2024. Your first instalment payable for the converted Instalment Loan may start as early as 1 July 2024.

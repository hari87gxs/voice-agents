================================================================================

We are unable to onboard if all directors and major shareholders in your company are foreign nationals without Singapore PR status.
To be eligible, your company must meet these two requirements:
Directors:
At least two directors must be a Singapore Citizen or Singapore Permanent Resident.
Shareholders:
All major shareholders (holding 25% or more of shares) must be a Singapore Citizen or Singapore PR.

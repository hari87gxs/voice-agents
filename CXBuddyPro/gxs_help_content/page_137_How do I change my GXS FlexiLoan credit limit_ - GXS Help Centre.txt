================================================================================

Increasing your credit limit is currently not available. However, you can lower the limit with the following four steps:
(Do note that if you lower your credit limit, you will not be able to increase it later. A reduction in your GXS FlexiLoan credit limit will also lower your Balance Transfer limit)
Log into your GXS Bank app.
In your FlexiLoan home screen, tap the Manage icon (beneath your available limit).
Select 'Lower credit limit'.
Input your preferred credit limit and click 'Confirm'.
Your new credit limit will take effect immediately.

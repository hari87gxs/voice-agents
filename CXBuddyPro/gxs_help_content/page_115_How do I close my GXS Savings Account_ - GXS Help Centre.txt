================================================================================

We’re sad to see you go. Before closing your GXS Savings Account, please close your Saving Pocket(s) if you've created any, and transfer any remaining account balance to another bank account. Any recurring payments arrangements will cease once your account is closed. Additionally, you will not be able to reinstate or reapply for a GXS Savings Account once you've closed your account.
We also encourage you to download all/any monthly statements as you may no longer be able to access the GXS Bank app once your account is closed.
Once you've done this, reach out to us to close your GXS Savings Account via:
GXS Bank app, Help Centre: GXS Chat (recommended)
GXS Hotline: 1800 866 6685 or (+65) 6866 6685 (from overseas)

================================================================================

We’re sad to see you go. Before closing your GXS Biz Account, do remember to transfer any remaining account balance to another bank account.
Do note you will not be able to reinstate or reapply for a GXS Biz Account once you've closed your account.
We also encourage you to download all/any monthly statements as you may no longer be able to access the GXS Bank app once your account is closed.
Once you've done this, reach out to us to close your GXS Biz Account. Our Customer Support Team is available everyday via:
GXS Bank app, Help Centre: GXS Chat
GXS Hotline: 1800 866 6685 or (+65) 6866 6685 (from overseas)

================================================================================

Unit trusts often offer several share classes to investors. Each class invests in the exact same portfolio of securities and has the same investment objectives. However, features such as launch dates and distribution channels can differ.
Class G is available for subscription exclusively through GXS Bank (with the additional feature of complimentary group personal accident insurance cover, underwritten by Singapore Life Ltd.)
Please refer to the respective fund share class factsheet available on Fullerton’s
website
These differences reflect the unique servicing arrangements and distribution partnerships for each share class. Nonetheless, regardless of share class, investors across all share classes will benefit from Fullerton’s disciplined approach in their cash management strategy.

Do note that all GXS FlexiLoan applications go through an evaluation process which is aligned with our internal requirements. This process includes an assessment of the applicant’s credit profile and eligibility - for example: Individuals currently under a Debt Consolidation Plan (DCP) or Debt Repayment Scheme (DRS) will not be eligible to apply.
For Grab users, including Grab drivers and delivery partners, your transactions and earnings may be relevant for credit assessments and could be shared between Grab and GXS Bank for these purposes.

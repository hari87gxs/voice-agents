================================================================================

Prior to funding your Boost Pocket, you can choose to either:
return the funds to your Main Account, or
renew the Boost Pocket (including base and bonus interest earned) for another term upon maturity
The choice is yours!
Changed your mind? Not to worry. You can make changes to the maturity instructions at any time before your Boost Pocket matures.

To open a GXS Invest account, you first need an existing GXS Savings Account. If you need help opening one, refer to our detailed guide

.
If you're already an existing GXS Savings Account customer, simply follow these steps to open a GXS Invest account:
1. Log in to your GXS Bank app.
2. Tap on 'GXS Invest'.
3. Tap on 'Create Account'.
4. Follow the guided instructions to create a GXS Invest account with Singpass Myinfo.
At the moment, you cannot open a GXS Invest account unless you hold a GXS Savings Account (even if you have any other GXS products/accounts). However, GXS Bank is exploring options to make GXS Invest available to these customers in the near future. Keep an eye out for updates from GXS Bank regarding this!

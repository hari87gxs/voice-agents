================================================================================

Yes! When you borrow your first loan, you'll have the flexibility to choose your preferred repayment date.
Pay day on the 15th of every month? You can choose to repay your GXS FlexiLoan on the same day. Prefer to consolidate all your bills to the end of the month instead? That's fine too – the choice is yours!
Do note that the repayment date you choose will be applied to all your monthly repayments across all your subsequent loans.

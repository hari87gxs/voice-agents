================================================================================

The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) represents the total borrowing cost, expressed as a yearly rate, relative to the initial loan amount.
The Effective Interest Rate (EIR) is the rate that reflects the true cost of borrowing and takes into account total charges. It's computed over a reducing balance basis and accrued daily.
For example, if you took a loan of S$10,000 with a tenure of 3 years:
APR: 3% p.a.
EIR: 5.69% p.a.
Tenure: 3 years
Borrowed loan amount: S$10,000
Total interest payable = Loan * APR * tenure
= S$10,000 * 3% * 3 years
= S$900
Monthly repayment amount = (interest payable + principal) / tenure
= (S$900 + S$10,000) / 36 months
= S$302.78
The interest payable component forms part of your repayment amount based on the interest accrued daily calculated using EIR and your outstanding principal balance.

Balance Transfer is one of the loan types that you can take from GXS FlexiLoan.
Balance Transfer
might be the loan for you if these are your needs:
Conserve cash by making smaller repayments each month over a shorter period. Minimum monthly repayment could be as low as 1% of your loan principal (or at such other rate as stipulated by the bank)
Select a loan tenure of 4 - 12 months (as assigned by the bank) and repay the remaining outstanding only at the end of the tenure
Enjoy 0% interest with a one-time processing fee (EIR 4.13% p.a.)
Do note that you can take a Balance Transfer only once, unless otherwise allocated by the bank.
Possible uses: Support your financial goals, emergencies, short-term business cash-flow cycles, managing multiple outstanding balances with a single facility etc.

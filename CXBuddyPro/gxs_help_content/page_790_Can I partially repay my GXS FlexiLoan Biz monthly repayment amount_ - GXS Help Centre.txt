Yes you can. However, please note that late interest charges will apply to any remaining balance of your monthly repayment amount that's not paid by the repayment due date.
To make a partial payment to a specific loan, here's how:
On your GXS FlexiLoan Biz home screen, select the loan you'd like to repay.
Tap on ‘Pay Due’.
Select the amount you'd like to repay.
Select to repay with 'GXS Biz Account'.
Review your repayment details and click 'Confirm & Repay'.

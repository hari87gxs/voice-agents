2. On the ‘Sell Order’ page, select GXS Savings Account Main Account as your crediting method.
3. Key in a Sell amount. Do ensure the amount does not exceed your ‘Available Amount’*.
4. Review your order details in the order summary page.
5. Acknowledge that you have read the Invest Account Terms, Fund Documents as well as Risk Disclosures.

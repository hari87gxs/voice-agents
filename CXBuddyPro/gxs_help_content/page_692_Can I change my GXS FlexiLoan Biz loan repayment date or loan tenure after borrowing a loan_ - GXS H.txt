Unfortunately, you won't be able to. But here is what you can do instead:
Repay your outstanding loan(s).
Borrow a new loan with the new repayment date and loan tenure.
Make sure to keep track of your new repayment date and stay on top of your repayments to avoid late interest charges or penalties.

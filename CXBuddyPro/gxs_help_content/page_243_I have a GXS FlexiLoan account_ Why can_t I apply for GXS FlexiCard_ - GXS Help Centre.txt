================================================================================

We're sorry we can't offer you a GXS FlexiCard right now. We can only provide either a GXS FlexiLoan or a GXS FlexiCard to a customer. This means that if you already have a GXS FlexiLoan account, or have closed your GXS FlexiLoan account, you aren't eligible for a GXS FlexiCard.

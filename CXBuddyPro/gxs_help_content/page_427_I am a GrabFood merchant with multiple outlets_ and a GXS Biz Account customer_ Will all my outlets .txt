================================================================================

Rewards are issued at the outlet-level, subject to each outlet linking its Grab earnings settlements to the merchant's GXS Biz Account.
For example, if a GrabFood merchant with 3 outlets links all outlets to its GXS Biz Account, all 3 outlets will enjoy waived Islandwide Delivery (up to 12km).

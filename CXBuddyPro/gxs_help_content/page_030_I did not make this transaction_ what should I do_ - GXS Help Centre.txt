Let’s make sure that this is not a delayed or pending payment! For example, check if this payment is:
A subscription fee to a service, or fees charged at the end of a free trial.
To an unfamiliar business name. Some of the stores or restaurants you frequent have a different account or transaction name. Google their names to be sure.
Small fees. Some companies may charge you a small fee to make sure your payment details are accurate.

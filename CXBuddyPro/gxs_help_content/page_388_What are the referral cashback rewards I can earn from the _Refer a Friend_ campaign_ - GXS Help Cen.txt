================================================================================

For every friend you successfully refer who opens a GXS Savings Account, you will receive a S$5 cashback reward.
If your friend opens a GXS FlexiLoan or GXS FlexiCard, both you and your friend will each receive a S$10 cashback reward.
However, it's important to note that as the referrer, you can only receive a maximum of S$10 cashback reward per friend, no matter how many different accounts your friend opens.
Your referee has to successfully open the GXS Bank product by 30 June 2025, and only the first 10,000 successful referrals during the campaign period will be eligible. So be sure to do it now!

================================================================================

From your Grab Merchant app homepage, you'll see the GXS Banking tile.
Tap on it, select ‘Switch to GXS Biz Account’ and follow the guided instructions.
Do note that once the account switch is approved, it will take around 3 business days for the GXS Biz Account to show up on your Grab Merchant app as your Grab settlement account.

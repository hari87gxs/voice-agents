================================================================================

The minimum repayment amount is the amount that you need to pay each month prior to the final month. The minimum repayment amount needs to be repaid on time to avoid late interest.
You may find your minimum repayment percentage allocated to you once you have successfully signed up for GXS FlexiLoan. It will also be reflected in your borrowing journey before you confirm the loan to borrow.

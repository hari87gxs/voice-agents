================================================================================

Yes, you can!
To move funds from your Dash Wallet to your GXS account, you can use the 'Send Money' function in the Dash app via two ways:
If you have set up GXS Savings Account as your PayNow account via Phone Number, you can enter that phone number within the PayNow option.
You can also send via your account number by pressing 'Bank/Wallet Account' and either doing a One Time transfer or add a recipient with GXS Bank as the Bank name, your account number (starting with 888) and your account name.

Eligible customers who purchase the Fullerton SGD Cash Fund - Class G through GXS Bank will receive a complimentary Group Personal Accident insurance coverage, underwritten by Singapore Life Ltd (Singlife) and will be insured up to 3 times the investment amount in the event of death or Total and Permanent Disability, subject to a maximum of S$100,000.
“Investment amount” refers to the market value of the Fullerton SGD Cash Fund as of the day of the accident. The market value will be determined by multiplying the units owned by you by the Unit Price as of the day of accident.
If you are 65 age next birthday and above at the time of accident, the coverage would be reduced to 50% of benefits payable, subject to a maximum of S$50,000.

================================================================================

A Personal Guarantee is not required when you open a GXS Biz Account.
However, if you've been offered GXS FlexiLoan Biz and you choose to accept, a Personal Guarantee from your company’s director will be required to guarantee the company’s loan obligations under the GXS FlexiLoan Biz terms and conditions.

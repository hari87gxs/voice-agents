================================================================================

Check if you’re using the right Singpass login. You should only be accessing the GXS Bank app with your own Singpass credentials.
Here are some troubleshooting guide to help you along:
Check your internet connection to ensure it's stable
Ensure your device operating system and GXS Bank app are updated to the latest version. The latest version of GXS Bank app is available on both Apple Store and Google Play Store
Ensure that you did not block all cookies in your browser settings
It is possible you may be accessing Singpass login during a maintenance period, which prevents you from logging in to your GXS accounts successfully. Refer
here
for MyInfo maintenance schedule.
To resolve any Singpass login issues, you may contact
Singpass Helpdesk
directly.

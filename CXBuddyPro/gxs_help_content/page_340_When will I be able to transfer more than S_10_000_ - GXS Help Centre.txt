================================================================================

For the first 14 days after opening your account, there is a daily transfer limit of S$10,000 within a 24-hour period.
For example, if you transfer S$2,000 at 3:00PM today, you will have up to S$8,000 remaining to transfer until 3:00PM tomorrow.
After the initial 14 days, this transfer limit will no longer apply!

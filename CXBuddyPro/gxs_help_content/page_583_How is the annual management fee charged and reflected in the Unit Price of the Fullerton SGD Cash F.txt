================================================================================

The annual management fee is already factored into the Fund’s Unit Price on every dealing day, and no further deductions are made when fund units are bought or sold.
For example, If the unit price on a given day is S$1.2008, the redemption proceeds you will receive from selling 1,000 units is exactly S$1,200.80 without any other charges.

================================================================================

Yes, of course! GXS FlexiLoan is designed in a way that grants you the flexibility to structure your loans however and whenever you need them.
In combination with Balance Transfer, you can borrow up to 10 loans at any one point in time from your available credit limit instantly, with no additional checks or approvals.
This means that if you have already taken 1 Balance Transfer, you may only borrow up to 9 more Instalment Loans.
You'll have the flexibility to customize the loan amount, tenure and loan name of each loan.

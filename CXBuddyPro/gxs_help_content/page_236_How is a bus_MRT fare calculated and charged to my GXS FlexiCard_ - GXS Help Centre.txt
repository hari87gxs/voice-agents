================================================================================

Your bus/MRT fare is calculated based on your journey, and it's deducted only when you exit a gantry. Under SimplyGo, your rides are bundled together and a final transaction is made either when you've clocked S$15 in fares or after five days of rides, whichever comes first.
If your GXS FlexiCard does not have sufficient credit limit to cover a ride or transaction, your account may go into overlimit state. Please make payment to your card account immediately.

================================================================================

You will receive one cashback reward (maximum S$10) for each friend that you successfully refer, regardless of the number of GXS Bank products he/she successfully signed up for.
For example, if your friend successfully signs up for a GXS Savings Account and a GXS FlexiLoan account, you will only earn S$10 cashback reward for that referral!
Cashback rewards are capped at S$10 per referral for both referrer and referee.

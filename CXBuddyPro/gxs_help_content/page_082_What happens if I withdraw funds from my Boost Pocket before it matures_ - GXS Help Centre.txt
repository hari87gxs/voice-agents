================================================================================

If you withdraw your funds from your Boost Pocket before the maturity date, all bonus interest that you could have earned will be forfeited. Your Boost Pocket will also be closed.
In order to maximise your earnings, it's best to keep your funds in your Boost Pocket until maturity.

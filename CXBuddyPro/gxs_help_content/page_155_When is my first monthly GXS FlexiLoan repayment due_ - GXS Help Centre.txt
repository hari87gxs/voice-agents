================================================================================

Your first monthly GXS FlexiLoan repayment due date will fall at least one month from the date that you've borrowed your first loan.
For example, if you borrow your first loan on 15 January and you've selected the 20th of every month as your repayment date, your first monthly repayment date will be on 20 February.

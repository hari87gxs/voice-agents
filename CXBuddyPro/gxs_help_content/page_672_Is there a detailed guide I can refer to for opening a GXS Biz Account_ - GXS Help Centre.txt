================================================================================

Here’s a step-by-step guide to opening a GXS Biz Account, once you’ve received an invite from us.
Search for 'GXS Bank' in Apple Store or Google Play Store. Download the latest version and launch it.
You should then see the options to view Personal banking or Business banking.
Tap on 'Business banking' and the next page should show you the GXS Biz Account. Tap on ‘Sign Up Now’ to begin the application process.
You'll then be asked to log in with your Singpass details, in order for your personal and ACRA information to be shared with GXS Bank.
Once you’ve provided your consent and approval, the next few screens will display your personal and company information retrieved from Singpass MyInfo and ACRA respectively.
Tap on ‘Next’ accordingly.
Do check the information displayed to ensure that the information retrieved is valid and accurate. If you'd like to change the pre-filled information at anytime, just tap the arrow down on the right of the screen to display the dropdown options.
Next, we'd like to know more about your business information. When you encounter this next screen below, just fill in the details accordingly.
Purpose of business - Do pick the option closest to your line of business. If in doubt, select ‘Others’ and there will be a text-based field for you to key in.
Annual business income - Select a range from ‘less than $100,000’ to ‘more than $1,000,000'.
Anticipated level of account activity - We would like to know how often you may need to make a deposit or withdrawal of your GXS Biz Account. Select a range from 0 to above 1,000 transactions.
Anticipated amount of each transaction - For each deposit or withdrawal made in your GXS Biz Account, we would like to know the average amount of each transaction.
Source of funds - If in doubt, select ‘Others’ and there will be a text-based field for you to key in.
You’re nearly done!
Tap on ‘Get Both’ if you’d like to proceed with the bundled application. Or if you prefer to proceed with just a savings account for now, just tap on ‘Get GXS Biz Account’.
If your application is showing this message, don't worry. We may simply need a bit more time to assess your eligibility.
Just sit back, relax and wait for a notification from us within 2 business days.

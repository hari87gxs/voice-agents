You can view your GXS FlexiLoan monthly statements on the GXS Bank app, on the 3rd of every month. Here's how:
On the GXS FlexiLoan home screen, tap on 'Manage'.
Click on 'View Statements'.
Select a month to view your account statement.
Do note that your monthly statements will only be available after you've borrowed your first loan.

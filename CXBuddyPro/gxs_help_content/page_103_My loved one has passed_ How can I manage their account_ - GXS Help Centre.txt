================================================================================

Losing a loved one is not easy. Please reach out to us for guidance on how to manage your loved one’s GXS account. These are the steps you can take:
Apply for the legal documents to manage their account
Request for their asset information (optional)
Request to close their account
Getting the right legal documents depends on whether your loved one has left a will
If your loved one has left a will, and you are appointed in the will as the Executor of the estate, apply for a Grant of Probate.
If you are not able to find a will, or you know that your loved one has not left a will, apply for a Grant of Letters of Administration. You may wish to engage a lawyer to help you with the application.
Both Grants are court orders that will allow for the administration of your loved one’s estate.
For an estate worth under S$3 million, you can apply to the Family Justice Court. For an estate worth over S$3 million, apply to the Family Division of the High Court.
If your loved one’s estate is worth less than S$50,000, with or without a will, you may consider applying to the Public Trustee. The Public Trustee’s Office may assist with the distribution of the assets without a Grant.
To request for your kin’s asset information, please submit these documents to us:
Digital death certificate from the My Legacy portal
Identity document of notifier or personal representative
Proof of relationship (e.g. marriage certificate, birth certificate)
Originating Summons for Grant of Probate or Grant of Letters of Administration
To close your loved one’s account, please submit the following:
Death certificate of your loved one (e.g. digital death certificate from the My Legacy portal)
Grant of Probate or Grant of Letters of Administration
Identity document of Executor or Administrator of the estate, as named in the Grant
Proof of bank account details (to release the kin’s funds)
Note: If you are submitting copies of original documents, please ensure that the copies are certified true copies of original documents by a Notary Public or a practising Advocate & Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore.
You can submit digital copies to:

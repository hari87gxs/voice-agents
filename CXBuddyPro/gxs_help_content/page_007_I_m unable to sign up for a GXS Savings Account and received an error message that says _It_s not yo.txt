We are here to help! One common reason could be because you're not physically located in Singapore at the time of application. We suggest you try again when you're back in Singapore.
Another reason could be that your mobile device is connected to a Virtual Private Network (VPN). To re-apply for a GXS Savings Account, you’ll need to disable your VPN before we are able to process your application. You can turn it back on thereafter.
Need further assistance? You may reach out to us in one of the following ways:

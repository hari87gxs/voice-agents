Here are the three fees associated with GXS FlexiCard:
Annual fee
Flexi fee
Late fee
Annual fee of S$54.50 (inclusive of GST) is waived for the first year.
From the second year onwards, the annual fee will be incurred on each anniversary of your GXS FlexiCard. For example, if you successfully applied for a GXS FlexiCard on 1 January 2025, the first annual fee of S$54.50 will be charged on 1 January 2026. And for all subsequent annual fees, you will be charged on 1 January of the following years.
Eligibility for a waiver in subsequent years is determined annually and is subject to bank review.
Flexi fee of S$5 will be incurred for each billing cycle where you only make a minimum payment for your FlexiCard on/before payment date, but did not make full payment.
Late fee of S$50 will be incurred for each billing cycle where we do not receive at least minimum payment on your GXS FlexiCard by the payment due date.

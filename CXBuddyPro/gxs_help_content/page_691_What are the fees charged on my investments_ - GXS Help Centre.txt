================================================================================

GXS Bank does not charge any transaction fees when you buy or sell the Fullerton SGD Cash Fund through us. This means there are no front-end sales charges, withdrawal fees or platform fees, and we ensure that your full investment is put to work, and 100% of your money is actively invested.
The annual management fee is already factored into each dealing day's published unit price, and there are no further deductions made when units in the fund are bought or sold.
For more information on fees, you may refer to the Fee Schedule that can be found in the GXS Bank app. To access the fund documents:
1. Log in to your GXS Bank App.
2. Proceed to the GXS Invest homescreen.
3. Tap on ‘More’.
4. Select ‘Fee Schedule’.

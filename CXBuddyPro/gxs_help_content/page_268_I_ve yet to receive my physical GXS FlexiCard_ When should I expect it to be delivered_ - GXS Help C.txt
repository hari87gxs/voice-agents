Your physical GXS FlexiCard should be delivered to your mailing address within 5 business days after application. During festive periods, it may take longer for the card to reach you.
You may also wish to check that your mailing address is correct via the GXS Bank app:
Go to 'Profile' and tap on 'Mailing Address'.
If the address is incorrect, you can cancel and re-order your card. You can do so under 'Manage Card'.

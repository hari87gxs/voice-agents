The purpose of Money Lock is to secure your funds and add an additional layer of security to prevent cybercrimes.
If you're really in need of your funds, you can put in a request with our Customer Support Team to unlock them. They will require a video verification from you. Here’s how to do it:
Step 1: Contact our support team
Reach out to us via call at (+65) 6866 6685 or in-app chat.
Step 2: Verify your identity
To ensure the security of your funds, we require a video verification process. Our support team will arrange a call via Zoom where you will need to verify your identity. Do have your NRIC/FIN ready for this process.
Step 3: Unlocking your funds
Upon successful verification, your funds will be unlocked within 1 day. We will notify you once the process is complete and your funds are available for use.

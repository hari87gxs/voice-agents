================================================================================

Your GXS Savings Account is made up of your Main Account, Saving Pocket(s) and Boost Pocket, which can be added to the home screen of your GXS Bank app.
Your Main Account is for your regular transactions, and you can create up to 8 Saving Pockets for your saving goals. Just remember that you can only transfer funds from your Saving Pockets to and from your Main Account.
You may also lock your funds away in a Boost Pocket to earn base + bonus interest rates.
If you need to use your funds urgently, you can close your Boost Pocket before the lock-in period is over, earn the base interest to date and forfeit the bonus interest. You will need to fund your Boost Pocket from your Main Account during creation, and the funds from your Boost Pocket will return to your Main Account upon closure.

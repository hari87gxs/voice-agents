================================================================================

Yes, you can!
To move funds from your GrabPay Wallet to your GXS account, you can use the 'Transfer' function in the Grab app in two ways:
If you've set up your GXS Savings Account as your PayNow account via Phone Number, it will be available to select under 'Transfer to your PayNow account'.
You can also send money via your account number by pressing 'Bank account' under Transfer to a different account and adding a recipient with GXS Bank as the Bank name and your account number (starting with 888).

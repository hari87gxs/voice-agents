================================================================================

The settlement date is the date on which the amount that you've spent on your GXS FlexiCard is transferred to the merchant.
Since the settlement is initiated by the merchant, the settlement date can occur anytime from a few days to several weeks after your transaction date.
From the time of your transaction until the settlement date, there will be a hold on your card's credit limit for the transaction amount. This hold will reduce your available credit limit and will remain in place until the settlement date.

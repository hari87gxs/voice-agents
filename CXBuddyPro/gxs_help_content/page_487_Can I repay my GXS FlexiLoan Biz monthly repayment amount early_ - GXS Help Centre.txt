================================================================================

You can make monthly repayments at any time, and we won't charge you any fees for early repayments! When you repay early, the amount will be deducted from your principal balance before your scheduled repayment date.
Choose the option that best suits you:
1. Manual repayments: You can manually initiate repayments from your GXS Biz Account at any time before or on the repayment due date.
2. Repayment from a third-party bank account: You can transfer funds from an external bank account to your GXS FlexiLoan Biz account.

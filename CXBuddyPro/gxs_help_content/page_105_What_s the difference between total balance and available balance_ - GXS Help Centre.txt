================================================================================

Your total balance includes both your available balance and earmarked balance.
The available balance is the amount you have access to. You can use this money for transactions such as spending, withdrawal, and transfers.
The earmarked balance refers to funds that are still processing or on hold, and cannot be used. Payments can’t be made with your earmarked funds.

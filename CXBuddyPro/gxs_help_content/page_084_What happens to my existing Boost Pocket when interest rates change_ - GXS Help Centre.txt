================================================================================

The interest rates for your existing Boost Pockets remain locked for the placement period. If your Boost Pocket is set to auto-renew, the new prevailing interest rates at the time of maturity will apply upon renewal.
If your Boost Pocket is not set to auto-renew, your Boost Pocket funds will then be moved to the Main Account of your GXS Savings Account upon maturity. The Boost Pocket will then be closed.

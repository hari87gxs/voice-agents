================================================================================

Closure of your GXS Savings Account will result in the closure of your Boost Pocket too.
Prior to closure of your GXS Savings Account, you will have to withdraw all funds first (Closure of your account can only happen when there is zero balance).
Proceed to close your Boost Pocket first, and then on to your GXS Savings Account.
Pro tip: It's best to keep your funds in the Boost Pocket until the end of the tenure to maximise your earning!

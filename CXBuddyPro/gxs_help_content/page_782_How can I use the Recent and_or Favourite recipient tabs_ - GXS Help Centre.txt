================================================================================

You can easily initiate funds transfers to your recipients via either the 'Recent' or 'Favourite' tab.
If your recipient is a recent recipient or was saved as Favourite, you no longer need to manually key in a recipient's mobile number/NRIC/FIN/UEN/VPA/bank account number, as long as your recipient's funds transfer details remain unchanged.
Transfers are now just a tap away!

Definitely! The funds in your GXS Savings Account will continue to earn interest even after you’ve hit your maximum balance amount.
Here is an example, based on an interest rate of 1.08% per annum:
On 20 June 2025, your balance in your Saving Pocket(s) is S$95,000 at the end of the day. You will earn an interest of S$2.81 and it will be credited to your account on 21 June 2025. Your account balance on 21 June 2025 is now S$95,002.81. You will continue to earn interest based on this S$95,002.81 amount at the end of the day.
For your information, your deposits with GXS are aggregated and insured up to S$100,000 by the Singapore Deposit Insurance Corporation (SDIC).

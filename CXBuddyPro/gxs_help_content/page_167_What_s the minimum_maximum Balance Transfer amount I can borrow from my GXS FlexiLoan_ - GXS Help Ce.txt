================================================================================

The minimum Balance Transfer loan amount you can borrow from your available limit is S$1,000. The maximum is capped at your total available Balance Transfer credit limit.
Do note that even though you may have an available credit limit, you cannot borrow more loans if you currently have 10 loans that are not fully repaid.

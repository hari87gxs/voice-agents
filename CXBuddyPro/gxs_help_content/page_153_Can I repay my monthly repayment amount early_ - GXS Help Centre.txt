================================================================================

You can repay your monthly repayment(s) at any time, we won't charge you fees for being an early bird! When you make an early repayment, it'll be taken off your principal amount that's due before your scheduled repayment date.
We recommend taking out a loan only when necessary and with careful consideration. The GXS FlexiLoan product is designed to provide flexibility and support during unexpected situations. The bank conducts periodic reviews to ensure that our customers are using our products responsibly and with prudence.

Yes you can. However, please note that late interest charges will apply to any remaining balance of your monthly repayment amount that's not paid by the repayment due date.
To make a partial payment to a specific loan, here's how:
In your GXS FlexiLoan home screen, select the individual loan you’d like to repay.
Key in the amount you’d like to repay.
Select your payment method.
Review your repayment details and click 'Confirm & Pay'.

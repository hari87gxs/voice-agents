================================================================================

Interest is calculated on a daily, non-compounding basis. You can check your total interest saved upon entering your repayment amount.
If an early repayment is made, it will be deducted from your outstanding GXS FlexiLoan Biz balance on that day, resulting in interest savings for you as interest is calculated on a reduced outstanding balance instead. The interest amount that you saved will be shown in your GXS Bank app during the repayment process.
